## Project Overview

This is a self-directed project that blends offensive security with DevSecOps practices, focused around **Kubernetes**, **Wazuh SIEM**, and **cloud services (AWS/GCP)**.

### Current Goals

- Deepen Kubernetes security knowledge (RBAC, NetworkPolicy, PodSecurity, Runtime hardening).
- Integrate Wazuh for detection, alerting, and runtime log correlation.
- Simulate realistic offensive attacks and design defensive responses.
- Use scripting and automation with **Bash** and **Python**.
- Deploy on local and cloud.
- Document hands-on learning in a reproducible and extensible manner.
